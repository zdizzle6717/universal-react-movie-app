# universal-react-movie-app
This is a universal javascript app built with javascript on both the server side and client side demonstrated with simple movie and director data. The frontend is built with ReactJs and Flux while the API is built with HapiJs and Sequelize.js.


This is a work in progress.  For a similar, and more complete application built with AngularJs, see https://github.com/zdizzle6717/hapi-angular-stack
